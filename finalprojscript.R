##Script for my final project on wildfires and CO2 emissions in the United States:
##note: reflect the cumulative materials covered in class.

##article link: https://ourworldindata.org/wildfires

#read in data:
emissions <- read.csv("/cloud/project/annual-carbon-dioxide-emissions.csv")

#next steps:
#find spatial data, edit emissions df to only include united states, plot emissions x wildfires, 
#flags?, visualize data, make predictions, forecast observations
